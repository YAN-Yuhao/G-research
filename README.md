##This the Course Project for HKUST MATH 5470: Statistical Machine Learning (Spring 2024)

The objective of this study is to apply advanced machine learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and other large language models, to forecast short-term returns on 14 key cryptocurrencies.
We explored two approaches for predicting cryptocurrency prices:

1. LSTM Model: We improved an LSTM network, achieving good predictive accuracy by enhancing its design and parameter settings.
2. LLM Approach: We tested Large Language Models adapted for numerical data, which yielded moderate results.

The LSTM model proved more effective for this financial time-series forecasting task.
